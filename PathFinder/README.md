# PathFinder
Implemented the A* search algorithm using a priority queue and a Manhattan Distance heuristic and displayed it on a grid using pygame. 
This program allows the user to select a starting node, an ending node, and barriers, then run the search algorithm through clicking 
the space bar; the program then performs A* search, displaying the visited nodes in real-time. After completion of the search for 
the best path, the program highlight the shortest distance path between the starting and ending nodes in the grid.
